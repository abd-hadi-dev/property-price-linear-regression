# Area Property Price Forecasting using Linear Regression 🏙️📈

This project predicts the **future average property prices of urban areas** based on infrastructure development, commercial potential, and rental trends using **Multiple Linear Regression**.

---

## 📌 Objective
To forecast area-level price appreciation over 3–5 years for people especially in tier-2 cities, considering:
- Upcoming metro stations, highways, airports
- Distance to IT hubs and city centers
- Rental value index and commercial property value
- Infrastructure project score
- This model helps people to Increase their savings by investing in Areas that will have the best appreciation values in upcoming years in that area
- This model is best suitable for REAL ESTATE DEVELOPERS who Develop Layouts, Apartments , Commercials to provide comfort to their Clients with the Lifestyle and Connectivity

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 📊 Model
- Multiple Linear Regression (`sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression`)
- Evaluated using:
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - R² Score

---

## 📈 Outputs
- Feature importance (regression coefficients)
- Actual vs Predicted future prices plot
- Year-wise price projection for each area

## 🆕 Changelog

- ✅ v1 (Today): Initial regression model, evaluation, and feature importance
- 🔄 v2 (Tomorrow): Added year-by-year projected price columns and plots

---

## 🔄 Future Improvements
- Add real-world data (via APIs or CSVs)
- Try non-linear models (Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Deploy as a web app (Streamlit/Flask)
